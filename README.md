# myra-shell

A Golang implementation to use myracloud api via console.

## Requirements
- make
- go

## Getting started

- Run test
```
make test
```
- Build
```
# Generates a static compiled packed executable
make

# Alternative creates a static compiled nonpacked executable
make build
```
- Run
```
./myra-shell
```
Running myra-shell for the first time, it will ask for your Myra-API credentials.

## Status

Work in progress.
